# Numerical Calculus Exercises
This repository contains the solutions and related materials for the Numerical Calculus course exercises at University of SÃ£o Paulo. Each folder in this repository corresponds to a specific exercise assignment, each dealing with a different aspect of numerical methods and their applications.

## Folder Structure

- **Exercise 1: LU Decomposition**
  - `Codigo_EP1.ipynb`: This Jupyter notebook includes the implementation and demonstration of LU Decomposition used to solve systems of linear equations.

- **Exercise 2: Heat Transfer in a Chip**
  - `Ep2.ipynb`: This notebook simulates heat transfer in a chip, showcasing how numerical methods can address real-world engineering problems.

- **Exercise 3: Gauss-Legendre Quadrature**
  - `Ep3_Codigo.ipynb`: Contains the implementation of the Gauss-Legendre method for solving integrals, with examples demonstrating its application.

## Usage

To view and run the notebooks, make sure you have Jupyter installed, which can be done via pip if you haven't installed it yet:

```bash
pip install notebook
```

To start Jupyter Notebook, run:

```bash
jupyter notebook
```

Navigate to the exercise notebook you want to view or modify. For example, to open the notebook for Exercise 1, you would navigate to the `Codigo_EP1.ipynb` in the Jupyter interface.
